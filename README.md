# PgxConnectFour

A version of this example game that uses Google's PGX and Monte-Carlo Tree Search to play Connect Four. The [original Jupyter notebook version](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sotetsuk/pgx/blob/main/colab/mcts_connect_four.ipynb#scrollTo=aPYOMRQZamsk) had stopped working over time. I reimplmented it as a real browser-based game using [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/). 

## To run the game
* At a command prompt, type `make install` to install the Rye dependency manager on your system (if needed). After Rye is installed, it will download the supporting Python libraries inside a virtual environment.
* Once the install has completed, type `make run` to launch the game.
